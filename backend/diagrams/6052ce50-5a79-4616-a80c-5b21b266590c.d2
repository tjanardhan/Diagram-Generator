Here is a D2 diagram code example for a Warehouse Management System:

```D2
direction: down

warehouse: {label: "Warehouse", shape: rectangle}
inventory: {label: "Inventory Management System", shape: cylinder}
picking: {label: "Picking Operations", shape: hexagon}
packing: {label: "Packing", shape: parallelogram}
shipping: {label: "Shipping", shape: square}
receiving: {label: "Receiving", shape: oval}
admin: {label: "Administration", shape: document}

warehouse -> inventory
inventory -> picking
picking -> packing
packing -> shipping
shipping -> onclick: "Shipping Operation" {shape: cloud, style: {fill: lightblue}}
shipping -> admin
receiving -> onclick: "Receiving Operation" {shape: cloud, style: {fill: lightgreen}}
receiving -> admin
admin -> inventory
```

This flowchart illustrates the workflow of a Warehouse Management System, where incoming inventory is managed by receiving, the system performs picking and packing operations, and outgoing inventory is shipped, all under administration control.
