Here is a simplified representation of a Warehouse Management System using D2 diagram, which might not be comprehensive but should give a basic idea. I'm using rectangles to represent process, ellipses for data, and diamonds for decision points.

```d2
start -> 'Receive Goods'[Input: Goods Information]
		| 'Login'[Input: User Credentials]

'Receive Goods' -> 'Check Goods'[Input: Goods Information]
				 | 'Store Goods'[Input: Goods, Storage Location]

'Check Goods' -> 'Verify Goods'[Input: Goods Information, Expected Goods Information]
			   | 'Reject Goods'[Input: Goods Information, Reason]

'Verify Goods' -> 'Update Inventory'[Input: Goods Information]
			       | 'Continue'

'Store Goods' -> 'Assign Storage Location'[Input: Goods, Available Storage Locations]
			  | 'Reject Goods'[Input: Goods, Reason]

'Assign Storage Location' -> 'Update Inventory'[Input: Goods, Storage Location]
						     | 'Find New Location'[Input: Goods, Available Storage Locations]

'Find New Location' -> 'Assign Storage Location'[Input: Goods, New Available Storage Locations]
					  | 'Reject Goods'[Input: Goods, Reason]

'Update Inventory' -> 'Save Changes'[Input: Inventory Details]
				  | 'continue'

'Login' -> 'Authentication'[Input: User Credentials, Database]
		| 'Deny Access'[Input: User Credentials, Reason]

'Authentication' -> 'Authorize'[Input: User Credentials, Role]
			     | 'Deny Access'[Input: User Credentials, Reason]

'Authorize' -> 'Initialize View'[Input: User Role, Inventory Details]
			| 'Deny Access'[Input: User Credentials, Reason]

'Deny Access' -> 'Logout'[Input: User Credentials]
			 | 'Reject'

end <- 'Logout'[Input:User Credentials]
```
