Here is the code for a flowchart for a Warehouse Management System:

```
direction: down

start: "Start" { shape: hexagon style: { fill: lightgreen } }

receive_goods: "Receive Goods" { shape: cloud style: { fill: lightblue } }
store_goods: "Store Goods" { shape: rectangle style: { fill: lightsalmon } }
issue_goods: "Issue Goods" { shape: rectangle style: { fill: lightyellow } }
track_inventory: "Track Inventory" { shape: cloud style: { fill: lightblue } }

receive_goods -> store_goods
store_goods -> track_inventory
track_inventory -> issue_goods
issue_goods -> end
```

This flowchart illustrates the following steps:
1. Start
2. Receive goods
3. Store received goods
4. Track inventory
5. Issue goods (retrieve from storage)
6. End (completion of the process)

Each of these steps is represented by a shape: `hexagon` for the starting point, `cloud` for tasks that involve receiving or sending data, `rectangle` for processing tasks, and `cylinder` is not used in this example.
